# 6-DOF Voice-Controlled Robotic Arm with Vision Integration

![Banner](./6DOF-Banner(1)(1).png)

A highly interactive 6-DOF robotic arm controlled via voice commands and enhanced with object detection using a camera and YOLOv8. This project integrates speech recognition, computer vision, and robotic control using Raspberry Pi 5 and Python, aiming to create a smart and intuitive robotic system for real-world tasks.

## ✨ Features

🗣️ **Voice Command Integration**  
- Uses Vosk for offline speech recognition.  
- Custom command parsing: `"pick up red and put over blue"`, `"rotate red 90 degrees"`, `"place red parallel to blue"`, and more.

📷 **Live Camera Preview**  
- Real-time video feed using `cv2.imshow()` to monitor object positions and arm movements.  
- Runs on a separate thread to avoid blocking other operations.

🧠 **YOLOv8 Object Detection**  
- Detects and localizes colored cubes (e.g., red, blue) using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.  
- Extracts object positions to guide arm movements intelligently.

🎯 **Smooth & Precise Servo Control**  
- Controlled via `adafruit_servokit`, ensuring smooth transitions for all 6 joints.  
- Movement functions are incremental and smooth for precise control.

💾 **Motion Presets with JSON Config**  
- Save and load custom arm positions using `"save preset <name>"` and `"load preset <name>"` voice commands.  
- All presets are saved in a `config.json` file for persistence.

🛑 **Pause & Resume (Safety Override)**  
- Voice-controlled `"stop"` and `"resume"` commands to pause/resume all arm actions.  
- Prevents unexpected movements for safety and debugging.

🧵 **Multithreaded Design**  
- Camera feed, servo control, and voice recognition run concurrently using Python threads.

🔊 **Text-to-Speech Feedback**  
- The system speaks back using `pyttsx3`, confirming commands and task status for full interactivity.
